## Project Objective
- Understand how keystroke capture techniques work
- Learn why keyloggers are a serious security threat
- Study how antivirus and EDR solutions detect such behavior
- Build defensive awareness for SOC analysts

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python scripting
- Endpoint behavior analysis
- Understanding attacker techniques
- Security awareness & mitigation

## Use Case
- Run only in controlled lab or virtual machine
- Intended for SOC / Blue Team learning

## Defensive Learnings
