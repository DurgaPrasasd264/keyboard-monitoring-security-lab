# Keyboard Monitoring Security Lab (Educational)

## Disclaimer
This project is developed strictly for educational and security research purposes.  
It demonstrates how keystroke logging works so defenders can better detect and prevent it.  
Unauthorized use on systems without permission is illegal.

## Project Objective
- Understand how keystroke capture techniques work  
- Learn why keylogging is a serious security threat  
- Study how antivirus and EDR solutions detect such behavior  
- Build defensive awareness for SOC analysts  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python scripting  
- Endpoint behavior analysis  
- Understanding attacker techniques  
- Security awareness and mitigation  

## Use Case
- Run only in a controlled lab or virtual machine  
- Intended for SOC / Blue Team learning  

## How to Run (Lab Setup)
1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/DurgaPrasasd264/keyboard-monitoring-security-lab.git  

2. Install required dependency  
   pip install pynput  

3. Run the script in a lab environment  
   python keyboard_monitor_demo.py  

4. Observe simulated output in `sample_output.txt`

## Practical SOC Scenario
**Scenario:**  
A SOC analyst receives an endpoint alert indicating suspicious keyboard input monitoring activity.

**Actions performed in this lab:**  
- Simulated keyboard input capture on a test system  
- Observed raw keystroke events generated by the process  
- Reconstructed readable input from raw keystroke data  
- Analyzed behavioral indicators that antivirus and EDR solutions may flag  

**Outcome:**  
This lab improves the analyst’s ability to recognize, investigate, and respond to keylogging-related threats in an enterprise environment.

## Defensive Learnings
- Behavioral indicators used by antivirus solutions  
- Detection of keyboard hook activity  
- Common prevention and mitigation techniques
